Let me find the relevant code to understand the current implementation.

I've read the ticket and the relevant code. Before implementing, I want to clarify a few things — the requirements span multiple stages and there are several reasonable interpretations.

**What's already in place (so I'm not duplicating):**

- `mirrorAssetBatchToR2` already emits per-asset `asset_mirrored` / `asset_failed` SSE events (`apps/control-app/src/operator/transcribe-site.ts:177-198`), and the final `summary.mirrorFailures` carries the count.
- The digest write is `await env.ASSETS_BUCKET.put(...)` — but there's no read-back verification.
- `read_transcription_digest` reads whatever is at `sites/{siteId}/transcription/digest.json` — no freshness or version check.

**Clarifying questions:**

1. **Asset mirror reporting** — the per-asset SSE events already fire. Is the gap that the **final tool return payload** only carries aggregate counts (`mirrored`, `mirrorFailures`) and not the per-URL failure list? You want the failed URLs + reasons in the returned `summary`?

2. **"Digest write should confirm"** — do you want a HEAD/GET read-back after `bucket.put` to verify the object is queryable before returning, or is the current awaited put + a tag/etag check sufficient? (R2 puts are atomic, so partial-bytes is unlikely; the practical risk is eventual consistency on read-back.)

3. **"Stale or partial digest" on read** — two interpretations:
   - (a) **Stale across converts** — the prior convert's digest still sits in R2 if a new convert is mid-flight or has crashed. Should `transcribe_site` *delete* the old digest at Stage 0 and `read_transcription_digest` return `not_ready` while none exists?
   - (b) **Versioning** — embed a `capturedAt` / generation id and have the caller pass an expected id to detect drift?
   - Or both?

4. **Module-building phase failure summary** — this is the one I most want to pin down. The "module-building phase" happens *after* `transcribe_site` returns, across many subsequent AI tool calls (`add_module`, `set_module_content`, `set_module_dial`, etc.). Three possible shapes:
   - (a) **Server-side accumulator** — the session tracks every failed tool call and exposes a `get_failed_actions` tool the AI must call before declaring done.
   - (b) **AI-called summary tool** — a new `report_module_failures` tool the AI is prompted to call at end of turn, listing what it knows failed.
   - (c) **Client-side display** — chat driver collects `action:failed` events and shows a "retry these" panel after the run.
   
   Which do you want? And what counts — every failed action handler call, or only module-mutation calls?
